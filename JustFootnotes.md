Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

Here section one[^1-4] and section two[^2-4] have footnotes.

Let's repeat the footnotes [^bignote] [^1-4] [^2-4].

Let's have some external links [1↗︎][1][1↗︎][1] [1↗︎][1] [[2↗︎][1]] [3][1] [[4][1]] [<sup>5↗︎</sup>][1] [1′][1].

Let's go with [[1↗︎][1]] [[2↗︎][1]] [[3↗︎][1]].

Or maybe go with [1↗︎][1] [2↗︎][1] [3↗︎][1].

Or the most compact form which would be  [`1`][1] [`2`][1] [`3`][1].

Or a readable form which would be  [`1↗︎`][1][`2↗︎`][1][`3↗︎`][1].
